# Building Managarm

This guide shows how to build a managarm distribution from source utilising the [bootstrap-managarm](https://github.com/managarm/bootstrap-managarm) patches and build scripts.

## Building a managarm distribution from source

### Build environment
To make sure that all build environments work properly, it is recommended to
setup a build environment with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) using the
provided [Dockerfile](https://github.com/managarm/bootstrap-managarm/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile).

Make sure that you have atleast 20 - 30 GiB of free disk space.

#### Preparations
First, create a directory which will be used for storing the
source and build directories. Here we use `~/managarm`, but it can be any directory.

```sh
mkdir ~/managarm && cd ~/managarm
```

The `xbstrap` build system is required on the host (whether you build in a container or not). `xbstrap` can be installed via pip3: `pip3 install xbstrap`.
You also need `git`, `subversion` and `mercurial` on the host (whether you build in a container or not). Install these via your package manager.

Clone this repository into a `src` directory and create a `build` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/managarm/bootstrap-managarm.git src
mkdir build
```

#### Creating Docker image and container
> Note: this step is not needed if you don't want to use a Docker container, if so skip to the next paragraph.

1.  A working `docker` installation is required to perform a containerized build.
2.  Build a Docker image from the provided Dockerfile:
    ```bash
    docker build -t managarm-buildenv --build-arg=USER=$(id -u) src/docker
    ```
3.  Create a `bootstrap-site.yml` file inside the `build` directory containing:
    ```yml
    container:
      runtime: docker
      image: managarm-buildenv
      src_mount: /var/bootstrap-managarm/src
      build_mount: /var/bootstrap-managarm/build
      allow_containerless: true
    ```
    This `bootstrap-site.yml` will instruct our build system to invoke the build scripts within your container image.

Now proceed to the Building paragraph.

#### Installing dependecies manually
> Note: if you created a Docker image in the previous step, skip this paragraph.
1.  Certain programs are required to build managarm; To get a list of the corresponding Debian packages we refer you to the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/managarm/bootstrap-managarm/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile)
1.  `meson` is required. There is a Debian package, but as of Debian Stretch, a newer version is required.
    Install it from pip: `pip3 install meson`.
1.  `protobuf` is also required. There is a Debian package, but a newer version is required.
    Install it from pip: `pip3 install protobuf`
1.  For managarm kernel documentation you may also want `mdbook`. This requires `rust` & `cargo` to be installed.
    Install it using cargo: `cargo install --git https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook.git mdbook`

### Building
1.  Initialize the build directory with
    ```bash
    cd build
    xbstrap init ../src
    ```
1.  There are several meta-packages available which control what software is build, this means that the build can be started using one of the following commands:

    If you want the full managarm experience with a selection of terminal and gui software available to try out use
    ```bash
    xbstrap install weston-desktop
    ```
    If you want to boot into `kmscon` and have some functional commands to play around with use
    ```bash
    xbstrap install base
    ```
    If you want some development tools in addition to the functionality of `base` use
    ```bash
    xbstrap install base-devel
    ```
    If you only want to build the bare minimum to boot into `kmscon` use
    ```bash
    xbstrap install --all
    ```
    Note that this command can take multiple hours, depending on your machine.


### Creating Images
> Note: if using a Docker container the following command are meant to be ran **outside** the Docker container, in the `build` directory on the host. Adding to the aforementioned commands, one would `exit` from the container once the build finishes, enter the `build` directory, and proceed as follows.

After managarm's packages have been built, building a HDD image of the system
is straightforward. The [image_create.sh](https://github.com/qookei/image_create) script
can be used to create an empty HDD image.

Download the `image_create.sh` script and mark it executable:
```bash
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qookei/image_create/master/image_create.sh'
chmod +x image_create.sh
```

This repository contains an `update-image.py` script to mount the image and copy the system onto it.

This script can use 3 different methods to copy files onto the image:
1. **Using libguestfs** (the default method). We recommend this when root access is not possible or desirable. However, it is much slower than method 2 and requires some setup on the host (see below).
2. **Using a classic loopback and mount** (requires root privileges). We recommend this when root access is acceptable because it is the fastest method and most guaranteed to work.
3. **Via Docker container**. This is handy in case the user is in the `docker` group since it does not require additional root authentication. We discourage this because it uses `docker run --privileged` (which is not safer than giving root access) and [currently has some bugs](https://github.com/managarm/bootstrap-managarm/issues/103).

Going with method 1 will require `libguestfs` to be installed on the host.
After installing `libguestfs` it might be necessary to run the following:
```bash
sudo install -d /usr/lib/guestfs
sudo update-libguestfs-appliance
```

If you're using xbstrap to invoke the script, selecting the desired method can be done by adding the following to the `bootstrap-site.yml` file:
```
define_options:
    mount-using: 'loopback' # or guestfs/docker
```

When invoking the script directly, selecting the method can be done with the `--mount-using` argument.

For all methods, the `image_create.sh` and `make-image` invocations shown below require the following programs to be installed:
`rsync`, `losetup`, `sfdisk`, `mkfs.ext2`, `mkfs.vfat`. Refer to [image_create](https://github.com/qookei/image_create#requirements) for more details on this.

Hence, running the following commands in the build directory
should produce a working image and launch it using QEMU:
```bash
# Create a HDD image file called 'image'.
# Check "./image_create.sh -h" for more options.
./image_create.sh -o image -s 4GiB -t ext2 -p gpt -l limine -be

# Copy the system onto it.
xbstrap run make-image

# Launch the image using QEMU.
xbstrap run qemu

# Or as a one-liner:
xbstrap run make-image qemu

# Alternatively, you can call the necessary scripts manually:
# Check their help messages for more information.
../src/managarm/tools/gen-initrd.py
../src/scripts/update-image.py
../src/scripts/vm-util.py qemu
```
