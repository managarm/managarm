## I Have a Question

Our primary way of communication is our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7WB6Ur3), please don't hesitate to ask a question there, we are more then willing to help. We also use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/managarm/managarm/issues). You can search here to see if a question has already been answered before.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/managarm/managarm/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Your input and the output
  - Can the bug be reproduced with the latest nightly image and/or with current packages from our package repositories?

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->
